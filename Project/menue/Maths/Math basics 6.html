            <details>
                <summary>Variables</summary>
                <p>In mathematics, variables are symbols used to represent unspecified numbers or values. They can take on different values and are often denoted by letters such as x, y, or z.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Constants</summary>
                <p>Constants are quantities with fixed values that do not change. They are often denoted by letters or numbers and can include fundamental constants such as Ï€.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Parameters</summary>
                <p>Parameters are variables that take on specific values depending on the context of a problem. They are denoted by letters and can represent constant values under certain conditions.</p>

            <h2>II. Rational Expressions</h2>
            <details>
                <summary>Definition</summary>
                <p>A rational expression is an algebraic expression made up of numbers, variables, and arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). It may include variables in the denominator of fractions.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Whole Rational Expression</summary>
                <p>A whole rational expression is a rational expression where there is no division by a variable.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Fractional Rational Expression</summary>
                <p>A rational expression is a fraction in which both the numerator and the denominator are polynomials. For example, (3x + 2)/(x - 1) is a rational expression.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Numeric Value of an Expression</summary>
                <p>The numeric value of an expression is obtained by replacing the variables with given rational numbers and evaluating the expression.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Allowable Values</summary>
                <p>Allowable values refer to the values that the lettered quantities in a rational expression can take. They may be restricted by conditions such as avoiding division by zero.</p>

            <h2>III. Monomials</h2>
            <details>
                <summary>Definition</summary>
                <p>A monomial is a single term algebraic expression. For example, 5x, -3y, and 7 are all monomials.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Normal Form of a Monomial</summary>
                <p>The normal form of a monomial is the standard way of writing it with the coefficient first followed by the variables in alphabetical order. For example, 3x^2y is in normal form.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Coefficient of a Monomial</summary>
                <p>The coefficient of a monomial is the numerical factor. For example, in the monomial 7x^2, 7 is the coefficient.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Power of a Monomial</summary>
                <p>The power of a monomial is the sum of the exponents of all the variables. For example, in 4x^3y^2, the power is 3 + 2 = 5.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Similar Monomials</summary>
                <p>Similar monomials have the same variables raised to the same powers. For example, 5x^2 and -3x^2 are similar monomials.</p>

            <h2>IV. Polynomials</h2>
            <details>
                <summary>Definition</summary>
                <p>A polynomial is an algebraic expression made up of two or more monomials. For example, 3x^2 + 2x - 5 is a polynomial.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
            <summary>Normal Form of a Polynomial</summary>
            <p>The normal form of a polynomial is the standard way of writing it with the terms in descending order of their degrees. For example, x^3 + 2x^2 - x + 5 is in normal form.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Coefficients of a Polynomial</summary>
            <p>The coefficients of a polynomial are the numerical factors of each term. For example, in the polynomial 4x^2 + 3x - 7, the coefficients are 4, 3, and -7.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Degree of a Polynomial</summary>
            <p>The degree of a polynomial is the highest power of the variable in the polynomial. For example, the degree of 5x^3 + 4x^2 - 2 is 3.</p>
